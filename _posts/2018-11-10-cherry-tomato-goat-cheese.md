# Cherry tomato deliciousness

We had a bunch of goat cheese and differently colored cherry tomatoes, mostly red and yellow, with some others. I wanted to make something with them.

## Ingredients

 - olive oil
 - a few handfuls of cherry tomatoes
 - minced garlic
 - a few dollops of goat cheese
 - salt, pepper, italian seasonings

## Directions

1. Heat up a good quantity of olive oil in a small skillet while slicing the tomatoes in half. It goes well with the goat cheese and tomatoes.
1. Add some minced garlic and let it cook until fragrant (20-30s)
1. Add tomatoes and stir, and then simmer them until it looks mostly like a sauce. Break the tomatoes up with a spatula. Add salt and pepper and other seasonings (maybe oregano, thyme, herbes de provence) as it cooks to get a variety of flavors.
1. Turn down the heat and add goat cheese. Break up slightly as you go. Turn off the heat. You want the cheese slightly blended, but also slightly chunky for the best results.
1. If adding fresh herbs (basil, etc.) then add these at the very end.

## Comments

I had recently made this and had some undercooked eggplant from another dish that I wanted to repurpose, and this worked out pretty well. I first cut the eggplant slices even smaller and fried them in some butter and added some salt, pepper, and maybe some other spices like herbes de provence. Then I set the eggplant aside and used that pan to make this dish, adding the eggplant to quickly reheat it before putting the cheese in. Overall it made the eggplant much better. I thought this would work well after reading about eggplant in The Flavor Bible and seeing that it paired well with all of the ingredients in this dish.

This would make an excellent pasta sauce, or is good just on its own. I would consider it as a side or appetizer if served with bread.
