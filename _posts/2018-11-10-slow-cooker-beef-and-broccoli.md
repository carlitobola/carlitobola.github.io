## Comments

Used fresh broccoli, microwaved. Didn't have sesame oil. I think the steak was a slightly differnt kind because the store was out of flank steak. Overall thought it was pretty good. Could probably use white pepper since it's an Asian-themed dish. Skipped the sugar. Used minced garlic from jar.
