# Kale Chips

Tags: appetizer, side dish, vegetarian, vegan, tried

Mostly just made this based on recipes I saw, similar to brussels sprouts recipe.

## Ingredients

 * kale
 * a little olive oil
 * kosher salt
 * freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Cut off any large stems of the kale and pull off any bad leaves. Mix all
ingredients together in a ziplock bag sheet pan and roast, until crispy. Shake
the pan from time to time to brown the kale evenly. Sprinkle with more kosher
salt and serve immediately.
